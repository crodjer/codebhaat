        Welcome to CodeBHAAT, IIT Kharagpur's own coding engine! We welcome you this innovative application to test your coding skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are various reasons why we develop such a system, major of them are, lack of programming practice amongst IIT Kgp peers, lack of awareness but most
        of all the want to code and compete amongst ourselves. On this engine you will find loads of practice problems pertaining to various fields of programming including
        Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Number Theory, Algorithms Games, Geometry, Cryptography etc. This is the perfect platform to hone your skills!
    </p>
    <p>
        We will also host myriad competitions ranging from long standing weekly questions to the hot and spicy cookoffs! There will be ranking provided to users on the basis
        of their performance. What's better than a showy ranking at CodeBHAAT ;).
    </p>
    <p>
        There's no delay until you decide, so don't waste your mouse clicks and goto register right now!
